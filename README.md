This C++ Snake game code manages the player's movement within a 20x20 grid using keyboard input (W, A, S, D) to control the direction. The snake's position updates with each input, and it grows longer when it eats a fruit (denoted by @), increasing the score by 5 points. The game renders the grid using ASCII characters and keeps track of the snake's tail using arrays. It checks for collisions with walls or the snake's tail, ending the game if a collision occurs. The game loops until the player either quits or loses.
