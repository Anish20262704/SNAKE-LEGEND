The code includes libraries such as iostream, cstdlib, ctime, conio.h, and windows.h. Global variables manage game state, dimensions, direction, positions, score, and tail details. The InitializeGame() function sets the initial game state, while RenderGame() draws the game board with the snake and fruit. CaptureInput() processes player inputs for movement and game exit. The UpdateLogic() function updates the snake's position, checks for collisions, and handles fruit collection. The Pause() function introduces a delay for smooth gameplay. The main() function executes the game loop, displays the score, and manages game termination.
